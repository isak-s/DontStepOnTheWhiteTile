My first Android application ever. downloadable and playable on your own mobile device if you copy the repo.
It's essentially a copy of [Don't step on hte white tile](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=jp.kino.whiteLine&pli=1) with a linked list implementation in 100% Java. 

The advanced Java programming course that I studyied during the creation of this project delved into great detail about specifically linked lists, which made me think of the FIFO queue as a natural data structure for managing the game's tile sequence. By implementing the tile grid using a linked list, I was able to efficiently update the game state as the player progresses, ensuring smooth gameplay with minimal overhead.

This project was a great opportunity to apply advanced Java concepts in a real-world mobile application. It reinforced my understanding of data structures, object-oriented programming, and Android development fundamentals. Additionally, I implemented file handling to save and load playthrough statistics, allowing players to track their progress over multiple sessions.

Overall, this project served as both a learning experience and a fun challenge, combining algorithmic efficiency with interactive UI design in a fully functional mobile game
